          The Demiguise is an ape-like creature with long silver hair that can
          turn invisible when threatened and can also predict the future. It is
          native to the Far East and a herbivore. When it is predicting the
          future, its eyes turn blue. Its hair is very valuable as it can be
          used to make invisibility cloaks, it is however very difficult to
          catch a demiguise due to their precognitive sight
