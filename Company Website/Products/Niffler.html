          The Niffler is a small, furry creature with a long snout and a coat of
          black, fluffy fur. They are attracted to shiny things, which made them
          wonderful for locating treasure, but this also means that they could
          wreak havoc if kept (or set loose) indoors. Nifflers in general are
          usually harmless. They are native to Britain, Ireland, and
          Scandinavian countries. They are also very popular as pets.
