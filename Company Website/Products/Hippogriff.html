          The Hippogriff is a magical creature that has the front legs, wings, and
          head of a giant eagle and the body, hind legs and tail of a horse. They
          are very proud creatures and are easily offended. Hippogriffs are
          trained by wizards to be ridden. They are native to Europe and are
          considered to be very dangerous. They are also known to make noble
          companions if treated with respect.
