          Neville Longbottom was a pure-blood wizard, the only child and son of
          Frank and Alice Longbottom. Neville's parents were well-respected
          Aurors and members of the original Order of the Phoenix, until they
          were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and three other
          Death Eaters with the Cruciatus Curse when he was about sixteen months
          old. Neville was subsequently raised by his grandmother, Augusta
          Longbottom.
