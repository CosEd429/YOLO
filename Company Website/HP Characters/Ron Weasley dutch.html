          Ronald Billius Weasley is the son of Molly and Arthur Weasley, two
          wizards who are among the most loyal allies to Harry Potter and his
          cause of defeating the Dark Lord Voldemort. Ron is Harry’s best
          friend, and they continue to remain best friends from the time they
          first met at King’s Cross station to the last time they are shown
          together in King’s Cross station in the epilogue.
