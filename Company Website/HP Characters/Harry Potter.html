        Harry James Potter is the son of the wizard James Potter and his wife
        Lily. Due to the fact that he is the only person in history to have
        survived the Killing Curse, he is possibly the most well-known wizard of
        his time. The curse, however, destroyed Lord Voldemort's body, who had
        attacked him and killed his parents.
