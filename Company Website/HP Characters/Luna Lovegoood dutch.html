          Luna was a witch, and the only child of Xenophilius Lovegood and
          Pandora Lovegood. She attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
          Wizardry and was sorted into Ravenclaw. She was very eccentric and
          strangely perceptive. She joined Dumbledore's Army and participated in
          battles during the Second Wizarding War. She fought at the Battle of
          the Department of Mysteries and Battle of Hogwarts, which she
          survived. Luna later became a Magizoologist.
