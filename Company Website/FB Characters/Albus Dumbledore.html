          Albus Dumbledore during Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald
          was the first time we saw him in the Fantastic Beasts series. He was
          the one who sent Newt Scamander to New York to release Frank the
          Thunderbird. He was also the one who sent Newt to Paris to find
          Credence Barebone.
          Albus Dumbledore is a very powerful wizard.
           He is the only wizard that has ever defeated Gellert Grindelwald.
